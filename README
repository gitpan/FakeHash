FakeHash - Simulate the behavior of a Perl hash variable
FakeHash::DrawHash - Draw a 'pic' diagram of the internal structure of a hash

By subclassing FakeHash::DrawHash, you should be able to get it to
draw the diagram in Your Favorite Drawing System without very much trouble.

A program to convert 'pic' code to GIFs is included.  It requires the
GhostScript and the PBM package.  The Makefile.pic will do this.  To
invoke it, try

        make -f Makefile.pic test.gif
